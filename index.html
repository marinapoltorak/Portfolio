            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              "I was born in the Soviet Union to my great surprise. I moved quickly to correct the situation. When my parents emigrated to the United States, I (three years old at the time)stowed away in their baggage. I has been an American citizen since the age of eight."
              Isaac Asimov
            </blockquote>
            <p> Just like Mr. Asimov, I was born in the Soviet Union. Unlike him, I wasn't released until 1976.</p>
            <p>To my unending surprise, shock even, my family was dropped into Houston, Texas.</p>
            <p>For 25 years now, I've been working as a counselor. I was a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was an addictions counselor. I have managed a team of gang mentors that work in our community. For over a decade I've gone into Oregon's medium and high security prisons to teach decision making and problem solving to an ever changing cohort of 18 to 25 year old boys. I am trauma informed, brain savvy and skilled in communicating with humans.</p>
            <p>That work was deeply rewarding and gave me much to live for, however...
            Over the years I've lost and grieved many clients. Lost them to gun violence, to heroin addictions, to long prison sentences. The trauma's weight on me became all encompassing. It started affecting my mood, my productivity, my health. Change became necessary.
            <p>I decided to pursue an old dream and learn to write code. Epicodus Bootcamp, PDX Code Guild Bootcamp, many Udemy courses and countless tutorials taught me JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and Git. I learned to Google for solutions. I've learned how to learn anything.</p>
            <p>So, here I am. Fat, fifty-ish, fabulous, frightened and frequently coding.</p>

                <li>University of Haifa, 1984</li>
                <li>PCC, 2005</li>
                <li>Epicodus for HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>PDX Code Guild for Python, JavaScript, Django</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Many professional events and certifications</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I studied Systemic Family Therapy with Bert Hellinger</li>
                <li>And many hours of transpersonal hypnotherapy and mindfulness</li>
                <li>I attended hundreds of hours of training to work with gangs and very young shooters.</li>
                <li>and many many hours of CBT training.</li>

            </div>
            <p>The Community Partners Reinvestment (CPR) is a program of Volunteers of America Oregon. It is designed to help young men with substance abuse issues transitioning from prison to live in Multnomah County. A collaborative of providers serve the young men, ages 18-25, and their families starting 3 to 6 months prior to release and continuing with more intensive services for at least one year post-release.</p>
            <p>I played an integral role in securing, implementing and reporting on three Federal grants aimed at reducing recidivism in young offenders. We raised funds to add mental health services to Latino youth and brought these services to Oregon Youth Corrections. I lead the team in communication, policy compliance and fidelity in gaining access and directing services inside DOC facilities as well as Community Justice institutions.</p>

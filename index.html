            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              "I was born in the Soviet Union to my great surprise. I moved quickly to correct the situation. When my parents emigrated to the United States, I (three years old at the time)stowed away in their baggage. I has been an American citizen since the age of eight."

Isaac Asimov
            </blockquote>
            <p> Just like Mr. Asimov, I was born in the Soviet Union. Unlike him, I wasn't released until 1976 (Yes, I am old. I'm 55. We will return to that.) Do you remember Jimmy Carter's grain for jews deal? Well, that is how we got a chance to leave the Soviet Union behind.</p>
            <p>To my unending surprise, shock even, my family was dropped into Houston, Texas. A prosperous oil town that instantly emerged from that prosperity as I landed. Remember the gas lines? No? You don't? Many of you are too young to remember 1976. Google it. It was sad.</p>
            <p>Houston was where and when I learned rebellion. Rebellion against my old-world father, against gender roles, against formal education, against monogamy. My poor parents! I hit puberty and America at the same time. In 1982, I almost failed to graduate from highschool. Had to take home ec, where I learned how to sow an apron and make lasagna. Then I pretended to go to the University of Houston, but the world was full of cute boys and great music. I was distracted. I rebelled. You must remember that. I moved in with a man and withdrew to Boca Raton, Florida. We built kit airplanes, aquired cats, fought and broke up. I devoted myself to high end electronic sales and found another man to follow. This time, it was Oregon. And my baby. And an old commune in the coastal range valley called Alpha Farm. Where babydaddy and I went our separate way.</p>
            <p>Time, unstoppable time, passes.I met the love of my life, married (25 years now) and moved to Portland. For 25 years now, I've been working as a counselor. I was a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was an addictions counselor. I have managed a team of gang mentors that work in our community. For over a decade I've gone into Oregon's medium and high security prisons to teach decision making and problem solving to an ever changing cohort of 18 to 25 year old boys. I am trauma informed, brain savvy and can make a grown man cry at a hundred paces. Really. Try me.</p>
            <p>That work was deeply rewarding and gave me much to live for, however...
            Over the years I've lost and grieved many clients. Lost them to gun violence, to heroin addictions, to long prison sentences. The trauma's weight on me became all encompassing. It started affecting my mood, my productivity, my health. Change became necessary.
            <p>So, here I am. Fat, fifty-ish, fabulous, frightened and frequently coding.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>This is how I learned to be who I am.</p>
            <p>There were formal educational opportunities:
              <ul>
                <li>University of Houston, 1982</li>
                <li>University of Haifa, 1984</li>
                <li>PCC, 2005</li>
                <li>Epicodus for HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>PDX Code Guild for Python, JavaScript, Django</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Many professional events and certifications</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I studied Systemic Family Therapy with Bert Hellinger</li>
                <li>And many hours of transpersonal hypnotherapy and mindfulness</li>
                <li>I attended hundreds of hours of training to work with gangs and very young shooters.</li>
                <li>and many many hours of CBT training.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Social Justice</h3>
          <h4>Community Partners Reinvestment and Nuevo Horizontes
            - A collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson
            Foundation</h4>
            <p>The Community Partners Reinvestment (CPR) is a program of Volunteers of America Oregon. It is designed to help young men with substance abuse issues transitioning from prison to live in Multnomah County. A collaborative of providers serve the young men, ages 18-25, and their families starting 3 to 6 months prior to release and continuing with more intensive services for at least one year post-release.</p>
            <p>I played an integral role in securing, implementing and reporting on three Federal grants aimed at reducing recidivism in young offenders. We raised funds to add mental health services to Latino youth and brought these services to Oregon Youth Corrections. I lead the team in communication, policy compliance and fidelity in gaining access and directing services inside DOC facilities as well as Community Justice institutions.</p>
